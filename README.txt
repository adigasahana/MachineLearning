I have started my analysis on Boston Marathon dataset of 2015, 2016 and 2017 year. I have chosen this dataset as I am a passionate runner and running inspires me to achieve higher.
I have done a basic analysis in R on Total participants, distribution of M Vs F for 3 yrs, median age of participants, country and participats etc
I will be digging deeper in coming days. I am also trying to analyse the same datset in Python.
